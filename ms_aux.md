\caption{Probability (0 = blue, 1 = red) of thermal exposure above 19\text{\textdegree}C in the North and South Thompson River watersheds. Median migratory period estimates projected during early (June), mid (July) and late (August) summer between 2014 and 2017. Points indicate spawning locations of chinook populations in the watersheds and their shape indicates their migration timing through the Albion Test Fishery near the mouth of the Fraser River.}
