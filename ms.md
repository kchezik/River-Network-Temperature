#Abstract

#Introduction

In the freshwater environment, temperature is a powerful and dynamic force that reflects complex climate and landscape interactions [@Webb:2008] and controls ecological processes [@Angilletta:2009]. As a manifestation of climate, freshwater temperatures and their impacts on biota are of increasing concern as global temperatures rise. The contribution of climate change to shifting freshwater temperatures is complexified by landscape dynamics that alter the manifestation of climate locally. For example, lakes are known to act as heat sinks, warming and stabilizing the thermal regimes of downstream rivers [@Lisi:2015b], while glaciers and steep slopes often contribute to stream cooling through the contribution of melt- and groundwater [@Cadbury:2008@; Lisi:2015]. The complex mixture of thermal contributions to freshwater temperature is a hierarchical aggregate of the contributing watershed (i.e., upslope area) [@Vannote:1980; @Isaak:2014]. As catchment area increases, a greater variety of landscape dynamics contribute to water's thermal profile and their relative importance shift in magnitude. This results in a heterogeneous structuring of temperature across the river network that organizes the thermal habitat and freshwater ecosystem [REF].

Organisms that move through the network experience shifting thermal habitat that exhibit varied degrees of extreme and variability [e.g., @Steel:2016]. Depending on an organisms thermal limits, network accessibility may expand and contract seasonally with lethal temperatures precluding access and sub-lethal temperatures limiting residence time. Passage through sub-lethal temperatures may be necessary to access optimal thermal habitat and different routes through the network will confer different levels of thermal risk. Renowned for their extrodinary migrations from the Pacific Ocean to the interior of Western North America, adult Pacific Salmon (*Oncorhynchus spp.*) forge through extreme climates and landscapes in order to reproduce in their natal streams [@Quinn:2018]. A coldwater species, adult salmon are often beyond their thermal optimum during their migration leading to thermal stress that can result in pre-spawn mortality [REF]. Spawning throughout river systems west of the Rockie Mountain range at different times throughout the year, species and populations experience varied levels of thermal risk depending on their migration timing and route.


Populations of a species residing within a commmon watershed (meta-population), share a migratory origin but may experience varied degrees of thermal risk 
	- Meta-population stability? Identifying at risk population because typically thermal stress is only considered on the spawning ground rather than the entire migratory route.



Network stabilizing properties and the shifting variance over space and time [Steel:2016].
	- Such integration of the landscape by the river network confers stability at the local level [@Moore:2015]. Therefore the river network stucture on the landscape 
	- As such, an organism's thermal experience is dependant on their location on the river network [e.g., @Benda:2004; Isaak:2010].
